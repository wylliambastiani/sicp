Exercise 1.6: Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to be provided as a special form. 
“Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?” she asks. 
Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of if:

(define (new-if predicate 
                then-clause 
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

- o new-if usa applicative order evaluation, assim ele executa ambas os parâmetros passados
para new-if como then e else clauses, fazendo com que chame sqrt-iter e trave o programa.
O if padrão da linguagem avalia apenas uma das expressões.
